              Our story takes place in a city-state called Terrend built into the side of a large moutain 
              where the higher up the face of the mountain you live, the higher standard of living you have. 
              Your family has lived in the lower sectors, the Rubble Yard, for generations and now struggle 
              with the coming plague striking the less fortunate citizens of the lower sectors. With the money
              you can spare, you leave home to purchase medicine for your younger sibling once they become ill.
              After sneaking your way into the middle sector to purchase medicine for the apothecary, you get 
              caught up in a series of unfortunate events, framed for stealing the medication, face trial, and 
              imprisoned to the Mines. Down below Terrend, you meet other prisoners who have given themselves
              the collective name, "Gravediggers" since no one has seen the light of day since imprisonment 
              and have to continue digging below the city until their deaths. They have built their own 
              self-sufficient community on the first floor above what they call "The Crypt," where monsters and
              ancient traps remain below. However, there is something buried deep in The Crypt that the
              government desparately wants, and if someone were to find it, their life sentence would be lifted.
              With the hope of finding whatever is buried below, you choose to dig and return back to your family
              on the surface.
