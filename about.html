                    My name is Hunter Funk and I am the head of Tanuki Games. I have had a passion for video games
                    ever since I was younger when my brother taught me to play co-op with him on his Playstation 2.
                    I have been interested in game development since middle school and my favorite type of game
                    would have to be JRPGs. Hollow Knight has been one of my favorite games and helped make me into 
                    a Metroidvania fan.

            <h1>About us...</h1>
            <p id="mission_statement">
                As an indie game software development company made of creative minds and players alike, 
                we wish to combine our efforts into a project we can all be proud of and give our audience 
                a gaming experience worth more than the money they spent. Our mission as a united team, 
                we wish to put our own mark in the gaming world and will strive to deliver a fulfilling 
                story to accompany challenging, yet rewarding gameplay emphasizing exploration, narrative, 
                and investment. <br> <br>
                We intend to use the initial $50,000 budget to begin development on a 
                Metroidvania-style game, with memorable characters, interesting 2D landscapes and dungeon 
                crawling, as well as a personal connection to our audience and supporters. The final game 
                we produce will not only be a work of passion on the teamâ€™s end, but also for those who 
                chose to support us during development. We have full intentions of making this project a 
                group effort and allowing our backers to have a hand in development, whether it is inspiring 
                dedicated characters to them, cosmetic items, or early access before the final release of the 
                game. <br><br>
                We envision an expected timeline that a finished master version of the game will be 
                available for release within two years of development and making the most of the initial 
                $50,000 in that time. Beyond that time limit if the game is not finished, we will be reliant 
                on money from our backers. If the game is finished by that time and there is excess funds or 
                has a successful launch, the extra money will be put into developing new additional content 
                for the game. Currently, the game is planned for release on Steam for PC.
